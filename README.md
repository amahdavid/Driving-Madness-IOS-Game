# Project Title: Driving Madness

Driving Madness is a simple solo-player game made in Xcode using Swift and Spritekit. You must shoot at incoming vehicles to earn points. However, if a vehicle passes by you, you lose a life. Colliding with an oncoming vehicle results in instant elimination, requiring you to start again. The game keeps track of the current round's score and the highest recorded score from previous playthroughs.
